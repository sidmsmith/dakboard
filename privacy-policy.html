  <h1>Privacy Policy for Dakboard</h1>
  <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 24, 2024</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Dakboard ("we", "our", or "us") is a smart home dashboard application that integrates with various services including Home Assistant and Google Photos. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  
  <h3>Data You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Assistant Credentials</strong>: We store your Home Assistant URL and access token locally in your browser (localStorage) to connect to your Home Assistant instance.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Photos Selection</strong>: When you use the Google Photos feature, you explicitly select which photos to share with the application. We store OAuth access tokens and your selected photo references locally in your browser (localStorage) to display the photos you've chosen.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data We Access</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Assistant Data</strong>: We access your Home Assistant entities including:
      <ul>
        <li>Weather data</li>
        <li>Calendar events</li>
        <li>Todo lists</li>
        <li>Garage door states</li>
        <li>Alarm panel status</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Google Photos</strong>: We only access the specific photos you explicitly select through the Google Photos Picker API. You control which photos are shared with the application.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Automatically Collected Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Widget Layouts</strong>: Your widget positions, sizes, and visibility preferences are stored locally in your browser.</li>

    <li><strong>Widget Management</strong>: To save and restore your widget layouts and preferences</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: To maintain secure connections to Home Assistant and Google Photos</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. No data is transmitted to our servers except:
      <ul>
        <li>API calls to your Home Assistant instance (using your configured URL and token)</li>
        <li>API calls to Google Photos Picker API (using OAuth tokens stored locally) to create picker sessions and retrieve only the photos you explicitly select</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>No Server-Side Storage</strong>: We do not store any of your data on our servers. All data remains in your browser.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or distribute your personal information to third parties. The only external services we interact with are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Home Assistant</strong>: Direct API calls to your Home Assistant instance</li>
    <li><strong>Google Photos</strong>: We use the Google Photos Picker API, which allows you to explicitly select which photos to share. We only access the specific photos you choose through the picker interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access</strong>: View all data stored in your browser's localStorage</li>
    <li><strong>Delete</strong>: Clear all data by clearing your browser's localStorage</li>
    <li><strong>Disconnect</strong>: Clear selected photos and revoke access to Google Photos through your Google Account settings or by clearing the application's localStorage</li>
    <li><strong>Control</strong>: Manage widget visibility and styling through the dashboard interface</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: All data is stored locally in your browser, encrypted by your browser's security mechanisms</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth Tokens</strong>: Google Photos Picker API tokens are stored securely in browser localStorage. Only the photos you explicitly select are accessible to the application.</li>
    <li><strong>No Transmission</strong>: Except for API calls to your configured services, no data leaves your browser</li>
  </ul>

    <li>We do not access your entire Google Photos library - only the photos you explicitly select</li>
